This book documents the genealogy of the McDonald family, focusing on the (male) descendants of James McDonald and Mary Welch. James and Mary were British 1820 Settlers who emigrated to the Cape Colony. This work aims to provide a comprehensive reference for the descendants of this lineage.

The book is divided into chapters that detail the lives and contributions of each generation, from James and Mary to the present day. Each chapter includes biographical information, historical context, and genealogical records.

The primary objective is to preserve the McDonald family history, ensuring that future generations have a detailed record of their ancestry. This book also includes information on allied families and significant individuals who played a role in the family's history.

Welcome to the genealogical record of the McDonald family.
