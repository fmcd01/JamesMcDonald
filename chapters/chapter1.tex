\section{Marriage of \mcdonaldJName{} and \welchMName{}}

On May 12th, 1817, \mcdonaldJName{} and \welchMName{} were wed at St Botolph without Bishopsgate, Bishopsgate, London. The marriage record shows \mcdonaldJNameOnly{} signing his name, while \welchMNameOnly{} made a mark ("+") next to hers. Both were listed as parishioners. \nettoIName{} and \nettoCNameNee{} witnessed the ceremony (Figure 1.1).

\section{Immigration to South Africa}

\mcdonaldJNameOnly{}, \welchMNameOnly{}, and their one-year-old son, \mcdonaldANameOnly{}, immigrated to South Africa with the British 1820 Settlers. Their names first appear in \biggarAName{}'s settler correspondence. This letter, dated September 27th, 1819, was addressed to \bathhurstHName{} from 3 Northumberland Court, Strand, London, in which \biggarASurname{} proposed a list of potential members for his party to South Africa. They are also referenced in his later settler returns (Appendix 1.3.3 provides a complete list and further details).

\section{Birth}

\mcdonaldJNameOnly{}'s birth date, birthplace, and parents remain unknown. The most reliable source is \biggarASurname{}'s 1820 list, which listed his age as 31. This suggests a birth year between September 28th, 1787, and September 27th, 1788. However, settlers often inflated their ages to qualify for the program, so this estimate should be viewed with caution.

FamilySearch and 1820settlers.com suggest \mcdonaldJName{} was born on October 9th, 1789, to \mcdonaldWWFullNames{} and \aitchisonJFullNames{} in Crawford, Lanarkshire, Scotland, with a baptism on October 11th, 1789. However, this lacks evidence to definitively link them. The birth date contradicts the age calculation above, and the suggested parents' names haven't reappeared among known descendants.

\section{Death and Descendants}

\mcdonaldJNameOnly{} must have died before November 7th, 1822. Marriage bans were published in Grahamstown on that date for \welchMName{}'s remarriage to \henmanRName{}.

\mcdonaldAName{}, born from the union of \mcdonaldJName{} and \welchMName{}, is their only known descendant.
