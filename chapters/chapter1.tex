\section[James McDonald and Mary Welch]{\mcdonaldJName{} and \welchMName{}}
\label{sec: James McDonald and Mary Welch}

\mcdonaldJName{} and \welchMName{} were wed on the \DTMdate{1817-05-12}, at \stBotolphWithoutBishopsgate{}, \bishopsgateFull{}. The marriage record shows \mcdonaldJNameOnly{} signing his name, while \welchMNameOnly{} made a mark ("+") next to hers. Both were listed as parishioners. \nettoIName{} and \nettoCNameNee{} witnessed the ceremony (Figure 1.1).

\section[Immigration to South Africa]{{Immigration to \southAfrica{}}}
\label{sec: Immigration to South Africa}

\mcdonaldJNameOnly{}, \welchMNameOnly{}, and their one-year-old son, \mcdonaldANameOnly{}, immigrated to \southAfrica{} with the \settlersBritish{}. Their names first appear in \biggarAName{}'s settler correspondence. This letter, dated \DTMdate{1819-09-27}, was addressed to \bathhurstHName{} from 3 \northumberlandCourtFull{}, \london{}, in which \biggarASurname{} proposed a list of potential members for his party to \southAfrica. They are also referenced in his later settler returns (Appendix 1.3.3 provides a complete list and further details).

\section[Birth]{Birth}
\label{sec: Birth}

\mcdonaldJNameOnly{}'s birth date, birthplace, and parents remain unknown. The most reliable source is \biggarASurname{}'s \settler{} list, which listed his age as 31. This suggests a birth year between \DTMdate{1787-09-28}, and \DTMdate{1788-09-27}. However, settlers often inflated their ages to qualify for the program, so this estimate should be viewed with caution.

FamilySearch and 1820settlers.com suggest \mcdonaldJName{} was born on \DTMdate{1789-10-09}, to \mcdonaldWWFullNames{} and \aitchisonJFullNames{} in \crawfordFull{}, \scotland{}, with a baptism on \DTMdate{1789-10-11}. However, this lacks evidence to definitively link them. The birth date contradicts the age calculation above, and the suggested parents' names haven't reappeared among known descendants.

\section[Death and Descendants]{Death and Descendants}
\label{sec: Death and Descendants}

\mcdonaldJNameOnly{} must have died before the \DTMdate{1822-11-07}. Marriage bans were published in \grahamstown{} on that date for \welchMName{}'s remarriage to \henmanRName{}.

\mcdonaldAName{}, born from the union of \mcdonaldJName{} and \welchMName{}, is their only known descendant.
